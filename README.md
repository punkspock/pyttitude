# Pyttitude (WIP)

While still a work in progress, Pyttitude intends to be an attitude determination and control system build in Python.

## Running the test simulations

Before running, create your virtual environment and/or make sure you have the packages in `requirements.txt` of the version specified installed.

To run the multi-satellite simulation:

`python satellites_simulation.py`

To run the single-satellite attitude determination and control simulation:

`python att_det_simulation.py`
